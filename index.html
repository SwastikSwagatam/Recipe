      Rasgulla or popularly known as Rosogolla in local dialect, actually originated <br>
      actually originated from Orissa and as with many other Indian sweet and  <br>
      dessert recipes, requires only three basic ingredients (milk, sugar and <br>
      lemon juice) which are easily available in any kitchen all the the  <br>
      time. In this step by step photo recipe of Rasgulla first chhena (aka  <br> 
      paneer or Indian cottage cheese) is prepared from milk using lemon   <br>
      juice and then small balls prepared from it are cooked in sugar syrup <br>
      to give it a sweet character.  <br>

    <li>Bring the milk to boil over medium flame. <br> Mix lemon juice with 2 tablespoons water.
    </li>
    <li>When milk comes to rolling boil, add water-lemon juice mixture gradually and <br> stir continuously using spatula. Solid milk portion and <br> whey portion will start to separate within minute or two. <br> Rinse it in running water or pour 2-3 glasses of plain water over it to remove sourness .
    </li>
    <li>Drain water and tie chhena in a muslin cloth. Squeeze it gently to drain the <br> excess water and hang it for 30 minutes to get the right amount of moisture. <br> Do not hang it for more than 30 to 45 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Untie the muslin cloth and transfer chhena to a plate.
    </li>
    <li>Crumble it with hand. It should be crumbly and little moist. If it is too dry,<br>rasgulla will turn hard and if it is too soft, they will break while cooking and will not <br> retain their shape after cooking.
    </li>
    <li>Make 13-15 small balls from kneaded paneer dough. The size of balls will <br> increase to almost double after boiling in sugar syrup in next step so do not make <br> very large balls
    </li>
    <li>Heat 1½ cups sugar with 4-cups water and cardamom pods in a large broad vessel <br>  (having lid) like pressure cooker or saucepan over medium flame and make <br> sugar syrup.
    </li>
    <li>When it comes to rolling boil, gently drop prepared balls in it. 
    </li>
    <li>Cover it with a lid and let it cook over medium flame. If you are using pressure <br> cooker, just put the lid over cooker, do not use whistle
    </li>
    <li>After about 5-minutes, remove the lid and stir it gently with a spatula. Again, cover it <br> with a lid and let it boil over medium flame for 7-8 minutes, stir it gently once <br> in between. Remove lid and turn off the flame. You will notice that size of balls <br> has increased to almost double.
    </li>
    <li>They will shrink a little after turning off the flame but it is normal. (If it shrinks too <br> much then its an indication that something has gone wrong.) Transfer <br> them to a large bowl and let them cool for 5-6 hours. Rasgulla are now ready for <br> serving.
    </li>
